# Password-Strenght-Analyzer
Let's say you have a database that contains users_data such as: username, password, email, etc....
A lot of users might make the mistake of having a weak password(less than 8 caracters, no upper cases, numbers, or special caracters).
Here when it comes the role of this app, all you have to do is insert a csv file containing the data of the users, your email or the email of your company,
an app code for email in the smtp_code field, and execute. The script will analyze all the passwords, and send a warning message to the users with weak one.
